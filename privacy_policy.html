<h1>Budgee – Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2025</p>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Roi Dital</p>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the Budgee app (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects
    your information. By using Budgee, you agree to the practices described here.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Notification Access (Google Wallet / Google Pay)</h3>
<p>
    Budgee requests permission to read push notifications. This permission is used
    <strong>exclusively</strong> to read transaction notifications from
    <strong>Google Pay / Google Wallet</strong>.
</p>
<p>From these notifications, the App extracts only:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Merchant name</li>
    <li>Transaction amount</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>No other notifications</strong> from any other apps or sources are read, stored, parsed, or collected.
</p>

<h3>1.2 SMS Access (Israeli Credit Card Providers Only)</h3>
<p>
    Budgee may request permission to read SMS messages. The App reads SMS content
    <strong>only</strong> from known Israeli credit card issuers, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Visa CAL</li>
    <li>Isracard</li>
    <li>Diners</li>
    <li>Other established Israeli financial institutions</li>
</ul>

<p>The App extracts only:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Merchant name</li>
    <li>Transaction amount</li>
    <li>Installments count (if included)</li>
    <li>Last 4 digits of the credit card (used solely for duplicate prevention)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The App <strong>does not read or process SMS messages</strong> from any other sender or source.
</p>

<h3>1.3 Financial Data You Enter</h3>
<p>Your financial data may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Expenses and income</li>
    <li>Budget settings</li>
    <li>Loans</li>
    <li>Salary (optional, only if provided)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This data is stored locally on the device in an
    <strong>encrypted SharedPreferences</strong> storage, and is also synced securely (TLS)
    to <strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong> under your unique user ID.
</p>

<h3>1.4 Authentication Information</h3>
<p>
    Budgee uses <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> to manage user login.
    Firebase securely stores your:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Password (hashed/salted using Firebase security protocols)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This information is not stored or handled by the App directly.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
    The information collected is used solely for the core functionality of the App:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Automatically recording expenses from Google Wallet notifications</li>
    <li>Automatically recording expenses from financial SMS messages</li>
    <li>Displaying and syncing your budget and financial data</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Your data is <strong>never sold, shared, or used for advertising.</strong>
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. Optional Data Sharing With OpenAI (ChatGPT)</h2>
<p>
    Some optional features in Budgee allow users to receive insights or summaries
    using OpenAI's ChatGPT API.
</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>You are shown an in-app privacy warning before any data is sent.</li>
    <li>The exact information being shared is clearly listed.</li>
    <li>You must explicitly approve the sharing before the feature is used.</li>
    <li>If you decline, no financial data is shared and the feature remains disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Data is only shared with OpenAI when the user directly authorizes it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>
    We take security seriously:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Local storage uses encrypted SharedPreferences</li>
    <li>All network communication uses TLS encryption</li>
    <li>Firebase Realtime Database is protected with strict security rules</li>
    <li>User data is isolated per account and not visible to other users</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
<p>
    Your financial data is stored for as long as your account remains active.
</p>

<p>You may request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time.</p>

<p>
    To request deletion, please visit:
    <br />
    <a href="https://roidital.github.io/budgee_web_pages/delete_my_account_request.html">
        Account Deletion Request Page
    </a>
</p>

<p>
    Once deletion is requested, all data in Firebase Authentication and Firebase
    Realtime Database associated with your account will be permanently removed.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
    Budgee is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13.
    We do not knowingly collect information from children.
